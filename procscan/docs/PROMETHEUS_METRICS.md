# ProcScan Prometheus Metrics Documentation

## Complete Metrics List

ProcScan provides comprehensive Prometheus monitoring metrics, covering scanner operation status, performance metrics, threat detection, and automated response capabilities.

### 1. Scanner Status Metrics

| Metric Name | Type | Description | Purpose |
|---------|------|------|------|
| `procscan_scanner_running` | Gauge | Scanner running status (1=running, 0=stopped) | Monitor whether the scanner is working normally |
| `procscan_scanner_uptime_seconds` | Counter | Scanner cumulative uptime (seconds) | Track scanner stability |

**Usage Scenarios:**
```promql
# Scanner availability check
procscan_scanner_running == 1

# Scanner uptime monitoring
procscan_scanner_uptime_seconds
```

### 2. Scan Performance Metrics

| Metric Name | Type | Description | Purpose |
|---------|------|------|------|

| `procscan_scan_duration_seconds` | Histogram | Single scan duration (seconds) | Analyze scan performance bottlenecks |
| `procscan_scan_errors_total` | Counter | Total number of scan errors | Monitor scan failure rate |

**Usage Scenarios:**
```promql
# Scan frequency
rate(procscan_scan_total[5m])

# Scan error rate
rate(procscan_scan_errors_total[5m]) / rate(procscan_scan_total[5m])

# Scan duration analysis
histogram_quantile(0.50, rate(procscan_scan_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))  # P50
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(procscan_scan_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))  # P95

- `severity`: Severity level (e.g., critical, high, medium, low, info)

**Usage Scenarios:**
```promql
# Threat detection trends
increase(procscan_threats_detected_total[1h])

# Top threats by type
topk(10, sum by (threat_type) (rate(procscan_threats_by_type[5m])))
